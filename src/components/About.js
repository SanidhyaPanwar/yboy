							Welcome to <b>Your Box of Yarn</b> â€” where threads become art, and every stitch tells a story.
						</p>
						<p>
							Iâ€™m a 51-year-old artist from <b>India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³</b>, turning passion into purpose. With over <b>20 years</b> of experience in crochet and knitting, Iâ€™ve found joy in creating, teaching, and sharing the timeless beauty of handmade crafts.
						</p>
						<p>
							My work blends <b>design, fashion, and tradition</b> â€” bringing modern style to classic techniques. Whether you're picking up a hook for the first time or refining your craft, you're in the right place.
						</p>
						<p className="highlight">
							ðŸ’¡ From cozy scarves to elegant home dÃ©cor, every creation starts with a single loop â€” and a bit of love.
						</p>
